This training is advanced than the Basic training. We recommend that only people who have undergone through  Basic Training, should go for this.
The obkective of this course is to deploy an application with a database backend using one or more of the orchestration tools below. The application that we are going to use for this workshop is [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org). OwnCloud is an open-source tool that one can host to store, sync and share their data. We will deploy ownCloud in this training and at the end of it, we will discuss advantages and pitfalls of these orchestration tools.
