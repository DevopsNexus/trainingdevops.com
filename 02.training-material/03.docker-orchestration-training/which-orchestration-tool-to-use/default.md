#Which Container Orchestration Tool To Use?

When we want to decide which contianer orchestration tool to use, we need to ask the following questions to ourselves.
1. What is the minimum infrastrucutre requirement to run the orchestration?
2. Does orchestration itself is fault tolerant?
3. Does it makes the application fault tolerant?
4. Do I need orchestration to run only containers?
5. Do I need service discovery? Do I need to set it up separately?
6. How good is the comunity support? Is commercial support available?
